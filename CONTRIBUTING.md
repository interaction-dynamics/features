# Contributing to Features CLI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Features CLI project! This document outlines the process for contributing and setting up the development environment.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable version)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management
- Git

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/interaction-dynamics/features.git
   cd features
   ```

2. Build the CLI:
   ```bash
   cd tools/cli
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

4. Test the CLI locally:
   ```bash
   cargo run -- ../../examples/javascript-basic
   ```

### Code Quality

Before submitting a PR, ensure your code passes all checks:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt --all

# Run clippy
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## Release Process

The project uses automated releases triggered by git tags. Here's how releases work:

### Publishing to crates.io and npm

When a new version tag (e.g., `v0.5.0`) is pushed, the GitHub Actions workflow automatically:

1. **Validates the code** - runs tests, linting, and formatting checks
2. **Builds binaries** - creates binaries for all supported platforms
3. **Publishes to crates.io** - publishes the Rust crate
4. **Publishes to npm** - creates and publishes npm packages for all platforms
5. **Creates GitHub release** - with release notes and binary attachments

### Required Secrets

For maintainers setting up the release workflow, the following GitHub secrets are required:

#### For crates.io Publishing
- `CRATES_IO_TOKEN`: API token from [crates.io](https://crates.io/me)
  - Go to crates.io → Account Settings → API Tokens
  - Create a new token with publish permissions
  - Add it as a repository secret

#### For npm Publishing  
- `NPM_TOKEN`: API token from [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  - Go to npmjs.com → Access Tokens → Generate New Token
  - Select "Publish" or "Automation" type
  - Add it as a repository secret

#### GitHub Environments
The workflow uses these environments (configure in repository settings):
- `crates-publish`: For crates.io publishing (requires `CRATES_IO_TOKEN`)
- `npm-publish`: For npm publishing (requires `NPM_TOKEN`)

### Version Management

1. Update the version in `tools/cli/Cargo.toml`
2. Commit the change: `git commit -am "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"`
3. Create and push a tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
4. The GitHub Actions workflow will handle the rest

### Manual Publishing (Emergency)

If automated publishing fails, you can publish manually:

#### To crates.io:
```bash
cd tools/cli
cargo publish
```

#### To npm:
Follow the steps in the GitHub workflow or use the existing npm publishing scripts.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
2. **Write descriptive commit messages** following conventional commits
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Ensure CI passes** - all checks must be green
6. **Keep PRs focused** - one feature/fix per PR

### Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat: add new feature`
- `fix: resolve bug`
- `docs: update documentation`
- `chore: maintenance tasks`
- `test: add or update tests`
