# Database Choice for Feature 2

## Context

Feature 2 requires persistent data storage for user preferences and application state. We need to choose an appropriate database solution that fits our JavaScript application architecture.

## Decision

We will use IndexedDB as the primary client-side storage solution, with localStorage as a fallback for critical settings.

## Status

Accepted

## Rationale

### Why IndexedDB?
- Native browser support without external dependencies
- Asynchronous operations that don't block the UI
- Supports complex data types and large storage capacity
- Transaction support for data consistency
- Better performance for complex queries compared to localStorage

### Why localStorage as fallback?
- Synchronous API for critical settings that need immediate access
- Broader browser compatibility
- Simpler API for basic key-value operations
- Persistent across browser sessions

## Consequences

### Positive
- No external database dependencies
- Works offline by default
- Fast local access to data
- No network latency issues
- Privacy-friendly (data stays on user's device)

### Negative
- Data is tied to specific browser/device
- No server-side data synchronization
- Storage limits imposed by browser
- Requires data migration strategies for schema changes

## Implementation Guidelines

### IndexedDB Usage
- Store user preferences and settings
- Cache application data for offline use
- Maintain transaction history
- Store complex objects and relationships

### localStorage Usage
- Theme preferences
- Language settings
- Critical user preferences that need synchronous access
- Temporary session data

## Migration Strategy

If we need server-side storage in the future:
1. Export data from IndexedDB to JSON format
2. Implement sync mechanism with server
3. Maintain hybrid approach for offline functionality
4. Gradual migration of data to server storage
