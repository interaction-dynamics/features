# Architecture Choice for Feature 2

## Context

We need to decide on the architectural pattern for implementing feature 2 in our JavaScript application.

## Decision

We will use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for feature 2.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to test individual components
- Better maintainability
- Familiar pattern to most developers

### Negative
- Additional abstraction layer
- Slightly more complex initial setup
- Potential for over-engineering simple features

## Implementation Notes

- Controllers will handle user input and coordinate between models and views
- Models will manage data and business logic
- Views will be responsible for rendering the user interface
- Event-driven communication between components
